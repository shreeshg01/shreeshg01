# 👋 Hi, I’m Shreesh Gurjar

**Master’s Student · Computer Science · University of Colorado Denver**  
Focused on **AI, Machine Learning, NLP, and research-driven development**

I build end-to-end systems — from models and algorithms to deployable, usable applications — with a strong emphasis on understanding *how* things work, not just making them run.

---

## 🚧 Currently Working On
- Developing an **interactive Java Swing Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** with real-time animations, multiple algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge), and responsive UI-thread–safe execution.
- Expanding **end-to-end NLP pipelines** covering classical ML, deep learning, transformers, explainability, and deployment.
