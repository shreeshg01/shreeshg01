# 👋 Hi, I’m Shreesh Gurjar

**Master’s Student · Computer Science · University of Colorado Denver**  
Focused on **AI, Machine Learning, NLP, and research-driven development**

I build end-to-end systems — from models and algorithms to deployable, usable applications — with a strong emphasis on understanding *how* things work, not just making them run.

---

## 🚀 About Me
- Master’s student passionate about applying **AI/ML to real-world problems**
- Strong interest in **Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision**
- Hands-on experience building, training, evaluating, and deploying ML models
- Research-oriented mindset: exploring **LLMs, sequence models (RNN/LSTM), and optimization techniques**
- I enjoy turning experimental models into **usable, well-engineered applications**

---

## 🚧 Currently Working On
- Developing an **interactive Java Swing Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** with real-time animations, multiple algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge), and responsive UI-thread–safe execution.
